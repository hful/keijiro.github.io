Keijiro Takahashi

Hi! I guess you're curious about me because I use [Unity], do [holographic
shows] or something of the sort, but actually I create [several things]
related to audio/visual. Check out my [dev log], [GitHub repos] and [Vimeo
channel] if you're interested.

Oh did I mention that I also create music? Not often but sometimes I share
them on [SoundCloud] and [YouTube].

You can ping me via [Twitter]/[Facebook]. In case of preferring good old
email, drop at [here]!
