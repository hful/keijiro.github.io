Keijiro Takahashi

I guess you're curious about me because I use [Unity], do [holographic shows]
or something like that, but actually I'm doing [several things] related to
audio/visuals. See my [dev log] or [GitHub repos] if you're interested.

Oh did I mention that I have a [Twitter] and a [Facebook] account? There are
also a [YouTube] and a [Vimeo] channel. Sometimes I make music and share on
[SoundCloud].

You can ping me via [Twitter] or [Facebook], or in case of preferring good old
email, drop to [here]!
